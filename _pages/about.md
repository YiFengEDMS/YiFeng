Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Yi Feng (please feel free to just call me Yi!). I am currently an assistant professor in [Quantitative Psychology](https://www.psych.ucla.edu/graduate/areas-of-study/quantitative-psychology/) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I have received my Ph.D. in Quantitative Methodology from University of Maryland, College Park, where I had the honor of being advised by [Dr. Gregory R. Hancock](https://education.umd.edu/directory/gregory-r-hancock). My research focuses on structural equation modeling, power analysis, and graphical causal models.

I have published methodological research in Psychological Methods
