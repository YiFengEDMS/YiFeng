Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Yi Fengâ€“but please feel free to just call me Yi! I am currently an Assistant Professor in [Quantitative Psychology](https://www.psych.ucla.edu/graduate/areas-of-study/quantitative-psychology/) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I earned my Ph.D. in Quantitative Methodology from University of Maryland, College Park, where I had the honor of being advised by [Dr. Gregory R. Hancock](https://education.umd.edu/directory/gregory-r-hancock).

My work primarily focuses on advanced quantitative methods and their application in psychology and education research. I have specific research interests in structural equation modeling (SEM), latent growth models, random variability modeling, power analysis/sample size determination, and causal graphical models.
